Due to overhead of \n  R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains \n  for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations \n  it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such \n  components are used more than once. \n  Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing \n  standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package \n  allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() \n  directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector \n  memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying \n  from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a \n  performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for \n  representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and \n  'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index \n  classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).",
